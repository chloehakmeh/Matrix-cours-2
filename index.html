<p>
Selfcare is good for you, especially when it comes to <strong> managing stress </strong>. And, chronic stress is one of the biggest threats to overall health. It’s linked to inflammation which can lead to everything from heart disease to gastrointestinal disorders and a weakened immune system.

Taking care of your self has other benefits that may be even more obvious. <strong> It feels good. </strong> 
Getting a good night sleep, for example, <strong> makes your day noticeably better </strong>. Of course, it also helps with focus and cognition, regulates emotions, and boosts immunity. Similarly, doing things like going to the gym, heading out for a walk, or taking a yoga class alter your mood and energy level.

<p> For some people self-care is a form of self-indulgence they either don’t make the time for or don’t think is necessary. But that may be because they don’t actually understand what it means. Self-care isn’t about weekly massages or buying yourself whatever you want #ideservethis-style. It’s a lot more basic. Some research on self-care describes brushing your teeth as a form of self-care. Let’s not call that an indulgence—even if you’re using the Burst rose gold edition.
Self-care, and its close cousin, self-help, are about <strong> being in tune with what your body and mind require to function optimally.</strong> In the same way you wouldn’t ignore the oil light on your car, you shouldn’t ignore the cues your body is sending you. Study after study has shown the positive effects of looking after yourself.
